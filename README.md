# AVL Trees

These are better versions of Binary Search Trees. The code only impliments AVL Trees for in-memory usage. It doesn't do disk storage (yet). the functions you can use are:
1. Insert
2. Search
3. Update
4. Delete

Refer to main.go for how to use them. And refer to avl.go for their code.

### Time Complexities:
1. **Insert**: O(log<sub>2</sub> N)
2. **Delete**: O(log<sub>2</sub> N)
3. **Update**: O(log<sub>2</sub> N)
4. **Search**: O(log<sub>2</sub> N)
